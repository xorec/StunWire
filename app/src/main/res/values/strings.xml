    <string name="manual_fragment_goal_title">The goal</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_goal_content">The goal of this application is to provide ability to
    establish direct encrypted connection via Internet with the partner without any servers and without
    dependency on any service infrastructure. This application can also be used for educational
     purposes. All the sources are available at the GitHub.</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_how_does_it_work_title">How does it work?</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_how_does_it_work_content">If we want to send a letter to some person,
        we have to know their address. It works exactly similar for the Internet connections.
        A server that is placed somewhere in the Internet which is available to connect always has
        it\'s domain name or at least known IP address, the address which is used to connect to the server.
    But what will happen if we want to connect not to the server, but to some other client, the ordinal
    network user? Ordinal users do not have their own static address to connect to. Instead, the ISP
        (Internet Service Provider), the company which provides Internet services to the user, \"divides\"
    the address between many users. Any request from particular user is then assigned a unique number
    (a port). So, in the case we want to connect to ordinal person via Internet, their address will be
    [IP address]:[Port] pair. If we know the pair, we can connect to the user.</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_how_to_use_title">How to use?</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_how_to_use_content">In order to establish connection with the remote partner,
    follow these steps:
    1. Select \"Start session\" button at the main screen;
    2. Choose session type;
    3. After a little delay you will see a screen with your address. Copy this info and send to your
    partner via other messenger;
    4. Ask your partner to send you their address as well;
    5. Enter partner address in the corresponding field;
    6. Press \"Connect\" button.
    If connection was successfully established, you will see a chat screen. If you want to finish session,
    open three-dots menu and press \"Disconnect\" button. The session will be finished, you will be no
    longer able to send messages. Session messages will be saved, you can access them by pressing the \"Saved sessions\"
    button at the main screen.</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_cellular_network_can_be_used_title">Can cellular network be used?</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_cellular_network_can_be_used_content">NO! Due to technical limitations
    only a Wi-Fi ISP connection can be used. For example, your home network or a cafe free Wi-Fi.</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_partner_identity_title">How can I check if I\'m talking to the intended
    person?</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_partner_identity_content">At the settings screen you can see your
    identity key image. This is the point of identity at this application. You can export the key image and send it
    to your partner via other messenger. When you\'re connected to the partner, you can briefly check their
    identity key image at the \"About partner\" screen. You can also check the full version of the key there.
    IMPORTANT: the [IP-address]:[port] pair cannot be the point of identity check as it can be corrupted by
    the STUN server or other intruder, because it is sent in plaintext, without encryption. So, for
    confidential conversations ALWAYS check the identity of the person you\'re talking to. Remember: your
    confidentiality is in your and ONLY your hands, this application is provided to you without any express
     or implied guaranties. By continuing using this application, you agree with these terms.</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_what_is_stun_server_title">What is STUN server?</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_what_is_stun_server_content">As was mentioned above, the ordinal Internet
    user does not have a static address to connect to, instead of this they have [IP address]:[port] pair.
    But the user does not know this pair in advance, until their request reaches the Internet. So,
    STUN server is the server placed somewhere at the Internet, which tells the user their pair
    via STUN protocol. STUN is the standardized protocol, any many free STUN servers exist, so you can
    always change the used server at the settings.</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_wait_title">Does STUN server participate in session?</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_wait_content">Not at all. A STUN server\'s the only purpose is to tell
    the user their [IP address]:[port] pair, which was provided by the ISP. That\'s all. A STUN server does not
    receive any session data, either encrypted or decrypted and does not participate in any way in the conversation.</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_how_to_change_stun_server_title">How to change STUN server?</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_how_to_change_stun_server_content">There are many free STUN servers. You can easily
    find their addresses by googling \"free STUN server\". Then, put the address in the corresponding field
    at the settings screen.</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_which_protocols_used_title">Cryptographic protocols</string>
    <string name="manual_fragment_which_protocols_used_content">RSA-2048 key is used as the identity key,
    which serves as the point of identity in this application. RSA key is used only for signing. ECDH
    is used as the key agreement protocol. For symmetric encryption, AES256-GCM is used.</string>
